Itâ€™s the year 2029. Faris, a curly-haired, slightly neurotic 21-year-old college student, is concerned about the ever-growing influence of Jeff Bezos and his economic empire. In particular, Faris wants to know how much money he spends on Bezos-related companies (his Bezosâ€™ "share of wallet").

So, he does what any enterprising young student would do: he builds a simple web tool to calculate how much money he spends on Bezos-related companies. This tool does the following in one UI:

- Shows Faris a list of his transactions for the month of January 2029, ordered by date.
- Allows him to visually discern which transactions are known to be Bezos-related companies.
- Lets him see how much money he pays to these Bezos-affiliated companies (both as a total dollar amount, and as a percentage of his spend).
- Allows him to mark or unmark any specific transaction as being Bezos-related, even if it is not to a known Bezos-related company.
    - If Faris marks (or unmarks) any transaction as being Bezos-related, all other transactions to the same *merchant name* are also be marked or unmarked in the same way. For example, if he marks any Lyft transaction as Bezos-related, all Lyft transactions become Bezos-related.
    - Any changes Faris makes are persisted for future use.

### Tech Stack

Faris built this web app using the following:

- Typescript
- React + [Material UI](https://mui.com/)
- Node.js + express
- REST
- Postgres + [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)

### Implementation Details:

- In Farisâ€™s implementation, Bezos owns **Amazon**, the **Washington Post,** **Whole Foods**, and space-travel company **Blue Origin**. Therefore, in the `prisma/seed.ts` file to seed the database, youâ€™ll see that Faris has already marked those merchants as belonging to Bezos.
- Faris didnâ€™t bother with authentication or security. (In 2029, it works magically through biometrics.)
- Faris's spending transactions are fetched from `GET` call to this URL: [https://61b3dea5af5ff70017ca20bf.mockapi.io**/**transactions](https://61b3dea5af5ff70017ca20bf.mockapi.io/transactions)**.** (This is a simplified version of what youâ€™d get from a service like [Plaid](http://plaid.com/).)
    
    <aside>
    ðŸ’¡ Faris makes this `GET` request from the backend to avoid a  `No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header` (also known as a [CORS Error](https://www.contentstack.com/docs/developers/how-to-guides/understanding-and-resolving-cors-error/)).  Note that, if you decide to move this `GET` request to the frontend in your implementation, you may encounter this issue. (Feel free to reach out with questions if this is unclear.)

    - New transactions can be added to this URL *every 10 seconds*, but transactions are immutable and can be identified by ID. (Once a transaction is added, it can never be removed.) If new transactions are added, Farisâ€™s front-end detects these new transactions and updates automatically (i.e., without requiring a page refresh) to display these new transactions.

    ðŸ’¡ If you want to test this out, you can clone the endpoint using this magic link: https://mockapi.io/clone/61b3dea5af5ff70017ca20c0. This will create a new fake endpoint that you can modify by adding, removing, and editing the underlying data.
    
    </aside>
    
- Faris decided not to store the transaction data itself, but he does store all data relevant to the application, such that Farisâ€™s changes persist for future use. Specifically, when Faris updates his Bezos-related expenses, those changes are saved to the database.
